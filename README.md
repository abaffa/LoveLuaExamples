# Löve 2D

LÖVE is a free multiplatform engine for developing 2D computer games. It uses Lua as a programming language and is published under the zlib license.

The engine API provides access to video and audio functions through SDL and OpenGL libraries and the fonts can be rendered by the FreeType engine. In addition, the physics engine Box2D is also available in the framework. Since version 0.8.0, it is also possible to use GLSL shaders.

Löve is still maintained by its original developers. More information, access www.love2d.org
